# Renewal
Renewal/Counting/Poisson Process Tools

This is a series of tools to estimate the mean cumulative function for renewal/counting processes. This is for both parametric and non-parametric methods, and aim to grow to be capable of Monte Carlo simulations. Aim was to create a set of tools to support the repyability package, but thought that a set of tools that could be used outside this narrow scope meant it deserved its own module. So here we are.
